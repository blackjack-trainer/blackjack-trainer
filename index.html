      CARD VALUES: <br>
      All cards are at face value except the King, Queen and Jack which count as 10. An Ace will have a value of 11 unless that would give a player or the dealer a score in excess of 21; in which case, it has a value of 1.
    </p>
    <p>
      OBJECT OF THE GAME: <br>
      Each participant attempts to beat the dealer by getting a count as close to 21 as possible, without going over 21.
